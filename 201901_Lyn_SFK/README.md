The presentation was produced using [presentationplotlib version 0.1](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/presentationplotlib/releases/tag/v0.1). In this version, each slide is created by its own script which generates one PDF file for each slide, at the end all PDFs are concatenated in a single file. A bash script was used to perform the whole operation.
