# Scientific Presentations

This repository hosts the code for my scientific presentations.

Final PDFs are not stored here, you will find a link in each subfolder to the final PDF which, most likely, will be hosted in my account in [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joao_Teixeira12/publications).

You may find of your interest [my other repository](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/presentationplotlib) where I forge a small library using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to draw PDF presentations.
